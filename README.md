Vault Prototype integration/staging tree
=====================================

Keyed Mining Coin
----------------

Vault-proto an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Vault-proto uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with a central authority: managing transactions is carried
out collectively by the network while issuing currency is carried out by keyed computers, where
keys are issued by a central authoridy.  Coin redemption is to be handled solely by the company 
in control of the mining keys.  

Otherwise the network behaves exactly as Litecoin Core, enabled for segwit and all the other bells and whistles.  

Current status:  Demo in progress
